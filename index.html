        <h4>I've been making games for Roblox since late 2024, I started this for fun but <br>

            Over time I joined communities and groups about creating games on Roblox and discovered <br>

                that you can make money from it. <br>

                    I recently don't have any projects of my own, but you can enter the area of <a href="">portfolio</a> <br>

                        to see some projects I have done.

                        <br>

                            in the tab <a href="AboutMe.html">About me</a> you will see more information about me.

                            <br>

                                already in the tab <a href="index.html">Home</a> you just came back here.
